  ;; The main benefit of schemas is that they offer code as documentation. They
  ;; are not a replacement for a type system, but can nevertheless be used for
  ;; input and output validation similar to how one would use :pre and :post
  ;; conditions. Schemas should never get in the users way, and thus in order to
  ;; use the validation capabilities you need to explicitly declare so by:
  ;;   - Using schema.core/validate or schema.core/check, e.g.

  (s/validate Square "a1") ; => "a1"
  (s/validate Square "i4") ; => Throws

  (s/check ChessPiece {:role "knight" :color "white"}) ; => nil
  (s/check ChessPiece {:role "janitor" :colr "white"})
  ; => {:role (not (#{"bishop" "rook" "queen" "pawn" "king" "knight"} "janitor"))
  ;     :color missing-required-key, :colr disallowed-key}

  ;;   - Enabling namespace wide validation as a part of running tests with
  (cemerick.cljs.test/use-fixtures :once schema-test/validate-schemas)

  ;;   - Or by forcing validation for key functions:
  (sm/defn ^:always-validate make :- Str [fen :- Str] ...)
  )

;; Setting this true will enable Schema's function validation globally
